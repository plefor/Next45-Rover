# Next45 Mars Rover Challenge V1.0

This is an implementation of Next45's Mars Rover Challenge.

### Version
1.0.0

### Technology

* [Java] -  This was used as the base platform due to its ease accessibility and cross platform capability.

The amount of libraries used was kept to a minimum. This allows the implementation to remain small, simple and efficient but still accomplish the necessary tasks needed from it.

### Installation and Usage

   - Download bin/Jar file of the master branch.
   - Ensure Java (the JRE) is part of your environment variables.
   - Run the Jar file from and console (such as Terminal, Command Line or PowerShell).
NB. The run.* files in the bin folder can be used as further reference to running the Jar file.


### Design Decision

Due to the simple functionality required, the design was kept simple. Focus was placed on a robust implementation that fulfills the challenge. Unnecessary  design patterns and excess functionality was avoided in order to achieve this. A single, self contained, class was used to achieve a minimal and complete solution to meet the requirements.

### Testing Done

 - Each method and section of code were individually tested through various inputs before used.
 - The Final implementation was tested by pushing through random inputs, as well as running through potential scenarios that may occur.

### Inputs

The inputs are as per the challenge requirements, with the addition to a "Q" command (which is used to quit).
